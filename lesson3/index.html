    <h1>Lesson 3: For Loop</h1>

    <p>
      In the second lesson, we increased the number of lines to 10. The curve
      stitch looks better now, but it's taking a lot of work to manually add
      more and more lines. In this lesson, we are going to use a
      <b>for loop</b> to draw the lines "automatically".
    </p>

    <p>
      Loops are one of the most important tools in writing an algorithm, so
      you'll want to practice them a lot!
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice in the code that we also use variables to encode the space between
      lines on the axis and the number of lines that we want.
    </p>

    <!-- Here we create our canvas -->

    <div class="canvas-container">
      <canvas id="mycanvas" width="500px" height="500px"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Set up
      var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
      var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

      // Declare some variables
      var canvasWidth = 500;
      var canvasHeight = canvasWidth; // Make width and height equal so it's square
      var numberOfLines = 10;
      var spaceBetweenLinesOnAxes = canvasWidth / numberOfLines;

      //
      ctx.beginPath();

      // Now we replace all of the individual lines with a single for loop!
      // As the number i increases from 0 to 9, the line being drawn will have one end increase along the x axis while decreasing along the y axis
      for (var i = 0; i < numberOfLines; i++) {
        ctx.moveTo((i + 1) * spaceBetweenLinesOnAxes, 0);
        ctx.lineTo(0, canvasWidth - i * spaceBetweenLinesOnAxes);
      }

      ctx.stroke();
      var width = canvas.offsetWidth;
      console.log(width);
    </script>
