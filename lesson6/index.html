    <h1>Lesson 6: Generalizing Rotation Angle</h1>

    <p>
      In the fifth lesson, we generalized our code in order to draw the curve
      stitch in any position, and to be able to easily set the size of the curve
      stitch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we are going to generalize the rotational angle at which the curve
      stitch is drawn. This is a slightly trickier thing to code for two
      reasons.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The command to rotate requires you to enter the angle in units of
        'radians' rather than degrees. If you don't know what a radian is, then
        don't worry. All you need to know is that it is easy to convert radians
        to degrees, and we have that conversion shown in the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we rotate something in a drawing, we need to ask what and where we
        are rotating it. Are rotating "everything" in the drawing, or just one
        shape within it? And about what point in the canvas plane are we doing
        the rotation?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In answer to this second point, it turns out in our case that we only want
      to rotate our individual curve stitch, and we want to rotate it about the
      point where we draw its corner. To do that, we first need to "translate"
      (i.e. move) the center of the whole canvas coordinate systems (which is
      set by default to be at the top-left corner of the canvas HTML element) in
      such a way that the corner of our stitch will be at the corner of the
      canvas. Then we rotate the whole canvas by some amount, then we draw the
      curve stitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that sounds confusing -- DO NOT WORRY! It took me a fair bit of trial
      and error to get the rotations done right, and that is NORMAL in coding.
      The great thing is, once you've figured something out in coding, you can
      save that research in your code and then start building upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how coding works: always start with something simple and then
      start improving upon it little by little.
    </p>
    <p>Here's our stitch rotated by 45 degrees clockwise.</p>
    <!-- Here we create our canvas -->

    <div class="canvas-container">
      <canvas id="mycanvas" width="500px" height="500px"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Set up
      var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
      var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

      // Declare some variables
      var canvasWidth = 500;
      var canvasHeight = canvasWidth; // Make width and height equal so it's square
      // Now we can just change numberOfLines to easily improve our curve stitch
      var numberOfLines = 20;

      // Let's introduce a new variable; instead of depending on the size of the canvas
      // let's explicitly control the sides of the curve stitch
      var cureStitchLength = 100;

      var spaceBetweenLinesOnAxes = cureStitchLength / numberOfLines;

      // Define coords for the corner of our curve stitch
      x = 100;
      y = 100;

      // First move the corner of the canvas on which we are drawing
      // to the place where we want to perform the rotation (the corner of our stitch)
      ctx.translate(x, y);

      // Now rotate the whole canvas by 45 degrees
      var oneDegree = Math.PI / 180;
      ctx.rotate(45 * oneDegree);

      // Now move the corner of the canvas back to its original position
      ctx.translate(-x, -y);

      // Code to loop through and draw 'numberOfLines' lines
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.strokeStyle = "white";
      for (var i = 0; i < numberOfLines; i++) {
        ctx.moveTo(x + (i + 1) * spaceBetweenLinesOnAxes, y + 0);
        ctx.lineTo(x + 0, y + cureStitchLength - i * spaceBetweenLinesOnAxes);
      }
      ctx.stroke();
    </script>
