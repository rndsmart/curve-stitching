    <h1>Lesson 1: Basic Curve Stitch</h1>

    <p>
      This is a series of lessons to learn the basics of javascript and how to
      draw in the browser. In this first lesson, we are going to draw some
      simple lines to create a basic "curve stitch" in an html canvas. (You can
      see a demo of a simple curve stitch being drawn
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WlMrcNNFog">here</a>). The
      canvas is sized to be 500x500 pixels, and the spaces on the axis for the
      curve stitch are separated by 100px (so we have just 5 lines).
    </p>
    <p>
      The code has lots of comments to help you understand what is going on. If
      you don't understand something in the code then GOOGLE it! (Half of all
      programming is just "looking it up on Google", be glad that you are
      learning code in the age of search engines.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't worry if you don't understand all of the little details. The
      most important concepts to grasp here are the programming patterns
      themselves (variables, loops and functions), NOT the detailed commands of
      javascript.

    <!-- Here we create our canvas -->

    <div class="canvas-container">
      <canvas id="mycanvas" width="500px" height="500px"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Set up to be able to draw on our canvas
      // We need to get a "handle" on our canvas within out JS code; we do this by
      // selecting it by the id we gave it in the html "mycanvas"
      var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
      // From that handle, we get a special 'object' called the 'context' that has within it all of the tools to draw colors and shapes on our canvas
      var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

      // Now we can start drawing stuff

      // Let's start with some lines; first, we have to let the browser know that
      // we want to start drawing a path of lines with this command:
      ctx.beginPath();
      // First line: to draw a line, we first move (without drawing) to one end of our line...
      ctx.moveTo(100, 0);
      // ... and then use this command to draw a line to the other end:
      ctx.lineTo(0, 500);
      // Second line
      ctx.moveTo(200, 0);
      ctx.lineTo(0, 400);
      // Third line
      ctx.moveTo(300, 0);
      ctx.lineTo(0, 300);
      // Fourth line
      ctx.moveTo(400, 0);
      ctx.lineTo(0, 200);
      // Fifth line
      ctx.moveTo(500, 0);
      ctx.lineTo(0, 100);
      ctx.stroke();
      var width = canvas.offsetWidth;
      console.log(width);
    </script>
