    <h1>Lesson 8: Function within a For Loop</h1>

    <p>
      In the seventh lesson, we reworked our code into a reusable function. This
      made it super easy to draw multiple curve stitches, and all we had to do
      was change the input values in order to create a simple four-pointed-star
      pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we are going to take that function and put it into another
      for loop. This for loop will repeat the same block of code to
      automatically vary the angle of rotation to increase by 45 degrees each
      loop. By running this loop 8 times, we can thereby easily generate an
      8-pointed star pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also positioned our curve stitches at the center of our canvas and made
      their size equal to half the canvas width.
    </p>

    <!-- Here we create our canvas -->

    <div class="canvas-container">
      <canvas id="mycanvas" width="500px" height="500px"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Set up
      var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
      var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
      // Declare some GLOBAL variables
      var canvasWidth = 500;
      var canvasHeight = canvasWidth; // Make width and height equal so it's square

      // Lets put our calls to draw a curve stitch into another for loop
      // and vary the angle of rotation
      for (var j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
        angleOfRotation = 45 * j;
        drawCurveStitch(250, 20, angleOfRotation, { x: 250, y: 250 });
      }

      /**
       * Let's take the code we developed previously, put it into a function,
       * and rework the most important parameters to our stitch as arguments to that
       * function; this lets us easily reuse our code
       *
       * Notice that each of these arguments has an equals sign followed by a number;
       * this is how you define a "default" value for the argument;
       * if you do not suppl a value for the argument, then this value will be
       * used instead.
