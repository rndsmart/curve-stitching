    <h1>Lesson 9: Further Functional Abstraction</h1>

    <p>
      In the eighth lesson, we put our function to draw a single curve stitch
      into another for loop in order to draw an 8-pointed star. Now we are going
      to take the for loop and put it into another function in order to be able
      to easily draw an 8-pointed-star pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we can easily draw multiple star patterns as shown. Moreover, we've
      probably already forgotten the details of how we drew a single curve
      stitch in the first place! We've abstracted that problem out into a
      function, and we don't need to remember those details; we can now start
      thinking in terms of a complete curve stitch and star pattern as our basic
      building blocks!
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopefully you've started to get a feel of the power of LOOPS and FUNCTIONS
      in order to be able to combine simple bits of code into more and more
      sophisticated products. Variables, loops and functions and the building
      blocks of programming. Once you know how to use them, you can build pretty
      much anything by starting simple and combining these pieces into something
      more and more elaborate.
